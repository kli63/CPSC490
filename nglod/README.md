# Neural Geometric Level of Detail (NGLOD)

This directory contains the NGLOD implementation for the CPSC490 project.

## Important Notes:

- The main RTX 4050 compatibility guide has been moved to the root directory: [../RTX_4050_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](../RTX_4050_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)
- The build script has been unified and moved to the root directory: [../build_rtx.sh](../build_rtx.sh)
- The testing script has been moved to the root directory: [../rtx_render_test.py](../rtx_render_test.py)

## Instructions

For detailed instructions on how to use NGLOD with RTX 4050 GPUs, please refer to the guide in the root directory of the project.

To set up the environment and build CUDA extensions:

```bash
cd ..
./build_rtx.sh
conda activate cpsc490_env
```

See the unified [README.md](../README.md) in the root directory for more information.
